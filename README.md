## ✨ Features

- 🪖 **Helmet Detection** – Ensures two-wheeler riders follow safety compliance.  
- ⛑️ **Seatbelt Detection** – Identifies drivers/passengers not wearing seatbelts.  
- 🧍 **Occupancy Detection** – Counts people in vehicles to monitor overcrowding.  
- 🔢 **License Plate Extraction** – Detects and extracts number plates using OCR (Tesseract).  
- 🖼️ **Image Enhancement** – Integrated **ESRGAN** for super-resolution on low-quality traffic footage.  
- ⚡ **Real-Time Analysis** – Built with **YOLOv5/YOLOv8 + OpenCV** for live video stream monitoring.
